# Food-Calorie-estimator
Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation AI App using Python, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. This project features a simple Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to upload food images, trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the type of food, and estimates calorie intake by matching predictions with a nutrition database.
